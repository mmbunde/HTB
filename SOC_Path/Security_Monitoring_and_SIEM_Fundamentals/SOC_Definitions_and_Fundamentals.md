# SOC Definitions and Fundamentals

## What Is A SOC?

A Security Operations Center(SOC) is a specialized unit within an organization dedicated to safeguarding its digital assets. It function as the central hub where a team of cybersecurity professionals constantly monitors the organization's network and systems for signs of cyber threats or security breaches.<br>
The primary goal of a SOC is to detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents in real time. This is accomplished using a combination of technology, tools, and structured processes. The SOC team typically includes security analysts, engineers, and managers who work together to ensure that the organization's cybersecurity posture is maintained at all times.<br>
To effectively monitor and detect threats, the SOC team uses various tools, such as:
* SIEM systems, which collect and analyze security data
* IDS/IPS, which identify and block potential threats on the network
* EDR tools, which monitor individual devices for suspicious activity

Additionally, the SOC team stays ahead of emerging threats by using threat intelligence and actively searching for hidden risks through a process known as threat hunting<br>
Beyond technology, the SOC operates using a set of established procedures to handle security incidents. These steps include:
* Triage: Assessing and prioritizing incidents based on their severity
* Containment: Taking action to limit the damage caused by a security incident
* Elimination: Removing the threat from the environment
* Recovery: Restoring normal operations after the incident has been resolved

The SOC team works closely with the incident response team to ensure that any detected threats are dealt with efficiently, thereby protecting the organization's overall security

## How Does A SOC Work?

A SOC primarily focuses on the day-to-day management of an organizationâ€™s information security. Unlike teams that develop security strategies or design security architecture, the SOC team is responsible for monitoring, detection, and responding to cybersecurity incidents in real-time.<br>
The SOC team mainly comprises security analysts who work together to identify threats, assess risks, respond to incidents, and report on their findings. In some cases, SOCs have advanced capabilities, such as forensic analysis and malware analysis, allowing them to perform deeper investigations into security incidents and identify root causes to prevent future attacks.<br>
Additionally, the SOC team works closely with the incident response team to ensure that security threats are handled effectively.<br>

## Roles Within A SOC

A SOC is staffed by a diverse team of professionals, each with specific roles to manage and protect an organization's security infrastructure. Some roles may be:
* **SOC Director**: Oversees the overall management, strategic planning, and alignment of the SOC with the organization's security objectives. This role includes budgeting and staffing
* **SOC Manager**: Manages the daily operations of the SOC, coordinates the team, and ensures collaboration with other departments, particularly during incident response efforts
* **Tier 1 Analyst**: Acts as the first responder by monitoring security alerts and events. They perform initial triage and escalate potential incidents to higher tiers for more detailed investigation
* **Tier 2 Analyst**: Conducts in-depth analysis of escalated incidents, identifies patterns, and develops strategies to mitigate security threats
* **Tier 3 Analyst**: Handles complex and high-profile security incidents, engages in threat hunting, and collaborates with other teams to enhance the organization's security posture
* **Detection Engineer**: Develop, implement, and maintains the detection rules and signatures for security monitoring tools, such as SIEM, IDS/IPS, and EDR solutions. They work closely with the security analysts to find gaps in detection coverage, improving the organization's ability to detect and respond to incidents
* **Incident Responder**: Leads the response to active security incidents, performing digital forensics, containment, remediation, and works to restore systems while preventing future attacks
* **Threat Intelligence Analyst**: Collects and analyzes threat intelligence to help the SOC team  understand the threat landscape and proactively defend against emerging risks
* **Security Engineer**: Designs, deploys, and maintains security tools and infrastructure, providing technical expertise to the SOC team
* **Compliance and Governance Specialist**: Ensures that the SOC's practices adhere to industry standards and regulations, and supports audit and reporting needs
* **Security Awareness and Training Coordinator**: Develops training programs to educate employees on cybersecurity best practices, promoting a security conscious culture within the organization

**Tier Structure**
This is a general structure but will vary from organization to organization and can be varied based on the size of the organization
* **Tier 1 Analysts**: Focus on monitoring and initial triage of security events, quickly identifying and prioritizing incidents for escalation
* **Tier 2 Analysts**: Perform deeper analysis of incidents, develop mitigation strategies, and fine-tune monitoring tools to reduce false positives
* **Tier 3 Analysts**: Handle the most complex incidents, engage in proactive threat hunting, and work on advanced security strategies to improve the organization's overall defense mechanisms

## SOC Stages

SOCs have evolved through three primary stages:

* **1. SOC 1.0**: The first generation of SOCs was heavily focused on network and perimeter security, often through isolated security layers like security intelligence platforms and identity management systems. However, due to poor integration, these systems generated uncorrelated alerts, leading to inefficiencies and a backlog of security tasks. SOC 1.0 was limited by its emphasis on network security, even as threats began exploiting other attack vectors. Some organizations still operate at this level, despite its limitations
* **2. SOC 2.0**: In response to the rise of sophisticated, multi-vector threats, SOCs evolved into SOC 2.0. This stage is characterized by the integration of security intelligence, threat intelligence, network flow analysis, and anomaly detection techniques to combat advanced threats like botnets and persistent attacks. SOC 2.0 emphasizes a comprehensive approach to security, including pre-event preparedness(e.g., vulnerability and configuration management), real-time situational awareness, and post-event analysis (incident response and forensics). Collaboration among SOCs and a forward-looking approach to threat research are crucial at this stage
* **3. Cognitive SOC (Next-Generation SOC)**: The cognitive SOC represents the next evolution, addressing the limitations of SOC 2.0, such as the lack of operation experience and the need for better collaboration between business and security teams. cognitive SOCs incorporate learning systems to fill experience gaps and improve security decision making over time. This approach aims to enhance the detection of threats specific to business processes and systems, while also standardizing incident response and recovery procedures
