# The Triaging Process

## What Is Alert Triaging?

Alert Triaging is the process used by the SOC analysts to evaluate and prioritize security alerts. The objective is to assess the threat level and impact of each alert to effectively allocate resources and respond to potential incidents. The process involves several key steps to ensure that alerts are handled efficiently and accurately<br>
In a SOC, escalation is a crucial aspect of managing security alerts. It involves notifying supervisors, incident response teams, or designate decision makers who have the authority to coordinate the response. SOC analysts provide detailed information about the alert, including its severity, potential impact, and initial findings. This enable decision makers to assess the situation and determine the appropriate course of action, suck as involving specialized teams, initiation broader response procedures, or engaging external resources if needed. Escalation ensure that critical alerts receive prompt and effective attention, facilitating coordination among various stakeholders and leveraging the expertise of higher level personnel to address complex or high severity incidents

## What Is The Ideal Triaging Process?

1. **Initial Alert Review**:
    * Examine the alert details such as metadata, timestamps, source and destination IPs, affected systems, and triggering rules/signatures
    * Analyze associated logs (network traffic, system, application) to understand the alert's context
2. **Alert Classification**:
    * Categorize the alert based on severity, impact, and urgency using a predefined classification system
3. **Alert Classification**:
    * Cross reference the alert with other related alerts or incidents to identify patterns or indicators of compromise (IOC)
    * Query the SIEM of log management system for relevant log data
    * Use threat intelligence feeds to check for known attack patterns of malware signatures
4. **Enrichment of Alert Data**:
    * Gather additional information such as network packet captures, memory dumps, or file samples
    * Utilize external threat intelligence sources or tools to analyze suspicious files, URLs, or IP addresses
    * Conduct reconnaissance of affected systems for anomalies like unusual network connections or file modifications
5. **Risk Assessment**:
    * Evaluate the risk and impact to critical assets, data, infrastructure
    * Consider factors such as the value of affected systems, sensitivity of data, compliance requirements, and likelihood of a successful attack
6. **Contextual Analysis**:
    * Consider the context of the alert including the affected assets, their criticality, and data sensitivity
    * Assess existing security controls and compliance requirements to determine if the alert suggests a control failure or evasion
7. **Incident Response Planning**:
    * If the alert is significant, initiate an incident response plan
    * Document details, assign team members, and coordinate with other teams (network operations, system admins, vendors)
8. **Consultation with IT Operations**:
    * Engage with IT operations or relevant departments to gather insights on affected systems, recent changes, or ongoing activities
    * Understand potential false positives and gain a comprehensive view of the environment
9. **Response Execution**:
    * Decide on the appropriate response based on the alert review and risk assessment
    * Take necessary actions or continue investigation if the alert indicates potential security concerns
10. **Escalation**:
    * Determine if escalation is needed based on the alert severity and organizational policies
    * Escalate to higher level teams or management and provide a detailed alert summary and risk assessment
    * Document all communications related to escalation and consider escalating to external entities if required
11. **Continuous Monitoring**:
    * Maintain ongoing monitoring of the situation and incident response progress
    * Provide updates to escalated teams and collaborate closely for coordinated response
12. **De-escalation**:
    * Assess if de-escalation is appropriate as the incident response progresses and the situation stabilizes
    * Notify relevant parties of the de-escalation and summarize actions taken, outcomes, and lessons learned

This process needs to be reviewed regularly and updated if necessary. This could include adapting to new emerging threat or if the business needs change and more aligning with the organization
