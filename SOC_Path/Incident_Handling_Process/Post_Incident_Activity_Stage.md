# Post-Incident Activity Stage

This is the stage for the lessons learned that came from the incident. It is best done soon after the incident report has been finished. All the stakeholders that were involved in the incident should be included in these lessons learned meeting.

## Reporting

The report should have answers and details to the questions below:
* What happened, when, and how long was the business effected?
* Performance of plans, playbooks, policies, and procedures? Do they need to change?
* Did the organization provide the necessary information and respond quickly to help the incident handling? What can be improved?
* What actions were taken to contain and eradicate the incident?
* What preventive measures should be put in place to mitigate the risk of this happening again?
* What resources does the organization need to detect and analysis similar incidents in the future?

These reports provided quantitative data for the organization like, how incidents are being handled, the time that it takes to handle an incident, and what steps were taken during the incident and if they were effective or not. This allows the reports to be used as a reference when similar incidents occur and for training the incident response team, so they are better prepared. They can also provide as legal documents showing how much the costs and impacts on the business were.<br>
When it comes to training, they can be used to on what or what not to do and also updating playbooks, policies, and procedures. This is also a time to reflect on how effective the tools, resources, the readiness of the team is, and how the team is structured. Maybe the team that was sent out was too small and caused someone to get burned out because the incident was much larger than expected and there wasn't anyone else that could fill in for that position.
