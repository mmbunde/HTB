# CYBER KILL CHAIN

**What Is The Cyber Kill Chain?**<br>
The cyber kill chain was developed by [Lockheed Martin](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html). It is a seven or eight step approach to threat actors or an Advanced Persistent Threats (APT) Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs).<br>

## 1. Reconnaissance

This step is where the threat actors gather information on their target. This can be by a passive means by looking at the company website, company social media (LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, etc.), employees, and company partners or vendors. This allows the threat actor to figure out where the weak points are for the company. It could be a job opening that they find and try to gain access to the company from the inside. This is just like the KnowBe4 [incident](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/knowbe4-mistakenly-hires-north-korean-hacker-faces-infostealer-attack/) that happened in July 2024, where they hired a North Korean state actor without knowing it.
