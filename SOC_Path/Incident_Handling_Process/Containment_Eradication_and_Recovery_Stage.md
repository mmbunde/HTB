# Containment, Eradication, and Recovery Stage

Once the investigation for the incident has been completed it is now time to move on to the containment stage.

## Containment

This stage is where the incident responder prevents the spread of the incident. They do this by have a short-term and long-term containment process. They also don't want to alert the threat actor that they have been detected and have them pivot to persist in the network.<br>
For the short-term containment you are looking to take quick actions or isolating the compromised systems. The incident responders can do this by putting the systems on an isolated VLAN, pulling the network cable out of the system, or changing the name of the threat actors DNS to something that they control or that leads to nothing
